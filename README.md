## INSTALLATION

Download the Anaconda platform:
https://www.anaconda.com/download/

This contains python and the data science packages we need. 

After installation, launch the Anaconda Navigator and open jupyterlab.  This opens a new tab in your web browser to run and manage your python scripts.

## DOCUMENTATION
Most of what we need can be found at [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)
